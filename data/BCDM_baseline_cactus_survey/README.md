# BCDM_baseline_cactus_survey
Bird Cactus Double Mutualism: Baseline Cactus Survey. Here we can find the data, analysis, and report for the preliminary cactus survey at Sunset Cove, Mojave. The survey helped us determine size-classes by which to bin cacti, as well as determine which cactu ssp. should be the study species for Malory's master thesis.
